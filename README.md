# HHS-Practical-Challenge
Hendall React Frontend Practical Exercise - VideoList Code Test

In this practical exercise for the React Frontend Developer code challenge.

<strong>Project Task Question for this React Code Challenge:</strong><br/>
Look at this page https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/playlist/highly-individualized-practices-series where each video is a node in Drupal 8 that includes a description and may include attachments and additional resources. Describe, providing as much technical detail as possible, how would you build the playlist functionality that appears on the page.

Main concepts in React include: 
- React JSX Components
- Project Structuring
- Lifecycle Methods
- State Management
- Props (parent-child) components
- Making API requests in fetching HHS Head Start videos via Drupal/Node model used for this project challenge. 

In this React Project, I will use the Google API/Youtube for real world testing of this concepts to use live fetched data from the Health & Human Services Channel, a link to test will available on my TrekkerQ Netlify hosted sandbox for review of this entire functional amazing app.
